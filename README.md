## Project Overview

The rise of online gaming has led to a significant increase in in-game purchases; a critical revenue model of many gaming companies. Understanding the factors that influence a player's likelihood to make these purchases is essential for game developers and marketers. This research investigates the relationship between player metrics and demographics with the likelihood of making in-game purchases. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can assist game developers in enhancing engagement and maximizing revenue through targeted strategies.

## Methodology

The project will use a combination of machine learning models, including K Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM. Each model will be evaluated for its predictive performance, and the results will be compared to identify the best model for this specific problem.

### Process Overview: 

1. **Data Pre-processing:** Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
2. **Model Development:** Load, evaluate, and optimize each predictive model.
3. **Analysis:** Perform data analysis to identify the best model.
4. **Visualization:** Create plots and graphs to visualize the performance of each model.
5. **Documentation:** Document the iterative changes and final results for each model.
6. **Evaluation:** Assess the impact on ROI and provide strategic recommendations based on the findings.
